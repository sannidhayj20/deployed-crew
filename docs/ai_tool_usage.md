## üïê Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Architecture Design (Week 1)
**Date**: January 15-21, 2025
**AI Tools Used**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4

#### Initial System Design Prompts

**Prompt 1.1 - System Architecture**
```
Design a multi-agent AI system for financial market briefings with the following requirements:
- Voice input/output capabilities
- Real-time market data integration
- Compliance and ethics filtering
- Professional Bloomberg-style output
- Support for global markets (US, Europe, Asia)

Suggest appropriate frameworks, agent roles, and data flow architecture.
```

**AI Response Summary**: Recommended CrewAI for agent orchestration, suggested 7 specialized agents, proposed sequential processing pipeline.

**Prompt 1.2 - Agent Role Definition**
```
For a financial AI system, define specific roles for 7 agents:
1. Query validator
2. Market data fetcher
3. Filing scraper
4. Knowledge retriever
5. Risk analyst
6. Narrative generator
7. Voice processor

Each agent should have: role, goal, backstory, and specific capabilities.
```

**Generated Agent Configurations**: See `config/agents.yaml` - all agent definitions were AI-generated and refined through iterative prompting.
